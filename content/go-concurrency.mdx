## Pipeline

### What is a pipeline?
The pipeline pattern is a common concurrency pattern in Go that allows you to efficiently process a stream of data by breaking down the processing into multiple stages. Each stage is a group of goroutines performing a specific operation on the data and passing it on to the next stage for further processing.

The common pattern for each stage:
... -- (inbound chan) --- values ---> [perform some function on the data] --- values ---> (outbound chan) -- ...

### Example: Squaring Numbers
Consider a pipeline with three stages.
The first stage, `gen`, is a function that converts a list of integers to a channel that emits the integers in the list:

```jsx
func gen(nums ...int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for _, n := range nums {
            out <- n
        }
        close(out)
    }()
    return out
}
```
The second stage, `sq`, receives integers from a channel and returns a channel that emits the square of each received integer. After the inbound channel is closed and this stage has sent all the values downstream, it closes the outbound channel:
```jsx
func sq(in <-chan int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for n := range in {
            out <- n * n
        }
        close(out)
    }()
    return out
}
```
<Callout>
Note: The go routine inside does not block the function that spawns it. Two go routines run synchronously because of the unbuffered channel. The sender blocks until there is a corresponding receive operation. When the in channel is closed (which "range" is waiting on), the receiver's loop stops.
</Callout>
The `main` function sets up the pipeline and runs the final stage: it receives values from the second stage and prints each one, until the channel is closed:

```jsx
func main() {
    // Set up the pipeline.
    c := gen(2, 3)
    out := sq(c)

    // Consume the output.
    fmt.Println(<-out) // 4
    fmt.Println(<-out) // 9
}
```
Since `sq` has the same type for its inbound and outbound channels, we can compose it any number of times. We can also rewrite `main` as a range loop, like the other stages:

```jsx
func main() {
    // Set up the pipeline and consume the output.
    for n := range sq(sq(gen(2, 3))) {
        fmt.Println(n) // 16 then 81
    }
}
```

### Fan-out & Fan-in
Fan-out refers to the process of distributing work across multiple goroutines or workers to perform tasks concurrently. Tasks are usually distributed across workers through a channel.

Fan-in is the opposite of fan-out and refers to the process of consolidating or combining the results from multiple workers into a single result. Each worker goroutine usually has its own channel to send the results back to the main goroutine. The main goroutine receives the results by multiplexing all worker channels onto a single channel which contains the final result.

### Example: Squaring Numbers (cont'd)

Change the pipeline to run two instances of `sq`, each reading from the same input channel. Introduce a new function, merge, to fan in the results:
```jsx
func main() {
    in := gen(2, 3)

    // Distribute the sq work across two goroutines that both read from in.
    c1 := sq(in)
    c2 := sq(in)

    // Consume the merged output from c1 and c2.
    for n := range merge(c1, c2) {
        fmt.Println(n) // 4 then 9, or 9 then 4
    }
}
```
- Distribute the squaring work to two goroutines to run concurrently (fan-out)
- Used a merge function to fan-in the results into one result and loop through it to print them out

The `merge` function converts a list of channels to a single channel by starting a goroutine for each inbound channel that copies the values to the sole outbound channel. Once all the `output` goroutines have been started, `merge` starts one more goroutine to close the outbound channel after all sends on that channel are done.

Sends on a closed channel panic, so it’s important to ensure all sends are done before calling close. The `sync.WaitGroup` type provides a simple way to arrange this synchronization:
```jsx
func merge(cs ...<-chan int) <-chan int {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    out := make(chan int)

    // Start an output goroutine for each input channel in cs.  output// copies values from c to out until c is closed, then calls wg.Done.
    output := func(c <-chan int) {
        for n := range c {
            out <- n
        }
        wg.Done()
    }
    wg.Add(len(cs))
    for _, c := range cs {
        go output(c)
    }

    // Start a goroutine to close out once all the output goroutines are// done.  This must start after the wg.Add call.
    // It does not block the function merge, which will let it return out and proceed execution with whatever is in there already
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(out)
    }()
    return out
}
```

### Stopping short
There is a pattern to our pipeline functions:
- stages close their outbound channels when all the send operations are done. (`close(out)`)
- stages keep receiving values from inbound channels until those channels are closed. (`for n := range in` in `sq`)

This pattern allows each receiving stage to be written as a `range` loop and ensures that all goroutines exit once all values have been successfully sent downstream.

But in real pipelines, stages don’t always receive all the inbound values. Sometimes this is by design: the receiver may only need a subset of values to make progress. More often, a stage exits early because an inbound value represents an error in an earlier stage. In either case the receiver should not have to wait for the remaining values to arrive, and we want earlier stages to stop producing values that later stages don’t need.

In our example pipeline, if a stage fails to consume all the inbound values, the goroutines attempting to send those values will block indefinitely:

```jsx
    // Consume the first value from the output.
    out := merge(c1, c2)
    fmt.Println(<-out) // 4 or 9
    return
    // Since we didn't receive the second value from out,
    // one of the output goroutines is hung attempting to send it.
}
```

This is a resource leak: goroutines consume memory and runtime resources, and heap references in goroutine stacks keep data from being garbage collected. Goroutines are not garbage collected; they must exit on their own.

We need to arrange for the upstream stages of our pipeline to exit even when the downstream stages fail to receive all the inbound values. One way to do this is to change the outbound channels to have a buffer. A buffer can hold a fixed number of values; send operations complete immediately if there’s room in the buffer:

```jsx
c := make(chan int, 2) // buffer size 2
c <- 1  // succeeds immediately
c <- 2  // succeeds immediately
c <- 3  // blocks until another goroutine does <-c and receives 1
```

And `incrementViews` is a Server Action that can be called like any JavaScript function:

```jsx
'use server';

import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';

export async function increment(slug: string) {
  await sql`
    INSERT INTO views (slug, count)
    VALUES (${slug}, 1)
    ON CONFLICT (slug)
    DO UPDATE SET count = views.count + 1
  `;
}
```

When the number of values to be sent is known at channel creation time, a buffer can simplify the code. For example, we can rewrite `gen` to copy the list of integers into a buffered channel and avoid creating a new goroutine:

```jsx
func gen(nums ...int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int, len(nums))
    for _, n := range nums {
        out <- n
    }
    close(out)
    return out
}
```

Returning to the blocked goroutines in our pipeline, we might consider adding a buffer to the outbound channel returned by `merge`:

```jsx
func merge(cs ...<-chan int) <-chan int {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    out := make(chan int, 1) // enough space for the unread inputs
    // ... the rest is unchanged ...
```
While this fixes the blocked goroutine in this program, this is bad code. The choice of buffer size of 1 here depends on knowing the number of values `merge` will receive and the number of values downstream stages will consume. This is fragile: if we pass an additional value to `gen`, or if the downstream stage reads any fewer values, we will again have blocked goroutines.

Instead, we need to provide a way for downstream stages to indicate to the senders that they will stop accepting input.

## Cancellation

### Explicit cancellation - the done channel

The main idea is that, when the downstream stages decide to exit, we want it to tell the goroutines in the upstream stages to abandon the values they’re trying to send. We can do it by sending values on a channel called `done`. It sends two values since there are potentially two blocked senders:

```jsx
func main() {
    in := gen(2, 3)

    // Distribute the sq work across two goroutines that both read from in.
    c1 := sq(in)
    c2 := sq(in)

    // Consume the first value from output.
    done := make(chan struct{}, 2) // the channel type must have some element type
    out := merge(done, c1, c2)
    fmt.Println(<-out) // 4 or 9
    // Tell the remaining senders we're leaving.
    done <- struct{}{}
    done <- struct{}{}
}
```

```jsx
func merge(done <-chan struct{}, cs ...<-chan int) <-chan int {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    out := make(chan int)

    // Start an output goroutine for each input channel in cs.  output
    // copies values from c to out until c is closed or it receives a value
    // from done, then output calls wg.Done.
    output := func(c <-chan int) {
        for n := range c {
            select {
            case out <- n:
            case <-done:
            }
        }
        wg.Done()
    }
    // ... the rest is unchanged ...
```

The sending goroutines from `merge` replace their send operation with a `select` statement that proceeds either when the send on `out` happens(which indicates that there is a receiver ready to receive) or when they receive a value from `done`. The value type of `done` is the empty struct because the value doesn’t matter: it is the receive event that indicates the send on `out` should be abandoned. The `output` goroutines continue looping on their inbound channel, `c`, so the upstream stages are not blocked. (We’ll discuss in a moment how to allow this loop to return early.)

This approach has a problem: each downstream receiver needs to know the number of potentially blocked upstream senders and arrange to signal those senders on early return. Keeping track of these counts is tedious and error-prone.

We need a way to tell an unknown and unbounded number of goroutines to stop sending their values downstream. In Go, we can do this by closing a channel, because a receive operation on a closed channel can always proceed immediately, yielding the element type’s zero value.

Sending empty structs as signal to done chan -> close the done chan

This means that `main` can unblock all the senders simply by closing the `done` channel. This close is effectively a broadcast signal to the senders. We extend each of our pipeline functions to accept `done` as a parameter and arrange for the close to happen via a `defer` statement, so that all return paths from `main` will signal the pipeline stages to exit.

```jsx
func main() {
    // Set up a done channel that's shared by the whole pipeline,
    // and close that channel when this pipeline exits, as a signal
    // for all the goroutines we started to exit.
    done := make(chan struct{})
    defer close(done)          

    in := gen(done, 2, 3)

    // Distribute the sq work across two goroutines that both read from in.
    c1 := sq(done, in)
    c2 := sq(done, in)

    // Consume the first value from output.
    out := merge(done, c1, c2)
    fmt.Println(<-out) // 4 or 9
    // done will be closed by the deferred call.      
}
```

Each of our pipeline stages is now free to return as soon as `done` is closed. The `output` routine in `merge` can return without draining its inbound channel, since it knows the upstream sender, `sq`, will stop attempting to send when `done` is closed. `output` ensures `wg.Done` is called on all return paths via a `defer` statement:

```jsx
func merge(done <-chan struct{}, cs ...<-chan int) <-chan int {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    out := make(chan int)

    // Start an output goroutine for each input channel in cs.  output// copies values from c to out until c or done is closed, then calls// wg.Done.
    output := func(c <-chan int) {
        defer wg.Done()
        for n := range c {
            select {
            case out <- n:
            case <-done:
                return
            }
        }
    }
    // ... the rest is unchanged ...
```

Similarly, `sq` can return as soon as `done` is closed. `sq` ensures its `out` channel is closed on all return paths via a `defer` statement:
```jsx
func sq(done <-chan struct{}, in <-chan int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        defer close(out)
        for n := range in {
            select {
            case out <- n * n:
            case <-done:
                return
            }
        }
    }()
    return out
}
```

Here are the guidelines for pipeline construction:
- stages close their outbound channels when all the send operations are done.
- stages keep receiving values from inbound channels until those channels are closed or the senders are unblocked.

Pipelines unblock senders either by ensuring there’s enough buffer for all the values that are sent or by explicitly signalling senders when the receiver may abandon the channel.

### Parallelism

The pipeline pattern enables parallelism by allowing multiple stages to execute concurrently. As soon as a stage finishes processing a piece of data, it can immediately start processing the next one, without waiting for the entire pipeline to complete.
